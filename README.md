# CS50x Problem Sets and Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and projects from **Harvard's CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science**.

## 📁 Structure
Each problem set is organized in its own folder:

- `pset1/` — C basics, Mario, Cash
- `pset2/` — Arrays, Caesar, Substitution
- `pset3/` — Algorithms, Sort, Plurality, Runoff
- `pset4/` — Memory, Filter, Recover
- `pset5/` — Data Structures, Speller
- `pset6/` — Python versions of earlier problem sets
- `pset7/` — SQL
- `pset8/` — HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- `final_project/` — My final project for CS50x

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my learning progress through CS50x and serves as a reference for future projects.

## ⚠️ Note
All solutions are my own work.  
Please use them only for learning — not for submitting assignments.
